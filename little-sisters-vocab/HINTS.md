# Hints

## General

- The Python Docs [Tutorial for strings][python-str-doc] has an overview of the Python `str` type.
- String methods [`str.join()`][str-join] and [`str.split()`][str-split] ar very helpful when processing strings.
- The Python Docs on [Sequence Types][common sequence operations] has a rundown of operations common to all sequences, including `strings`, `lists`, `tuples`, and `ranges`.

There's four activities in the assignment, each with a set of text or words to work with.

## 1. Add a prefix to a word

- Small strings can be concatenated with the `+` operator.

## 2. Add prefixes to word groups

- Believe it or not, [`str.join()`][str-join] is all you need here.  **A loop is not required**.
- The tests will be feeding your function a `list`.  There will be no need to alter this `list` if you can figure out a good delimiter string.
- Remember that delimiter strings go between elements and "glue" them together into a single string. Delimiters are inserted _without_ space, although you can include space characters within them.
- Like [`str.split()`][str-split], `str.join()` can process an arbitrary-length string, made up of any unicode code points. _Unlike_ `str.split()`, it can also process arbitrary-length iterables like `list`, `tuple`, and `set`.


## 3. Remove a suffix from a word

- Strings can be indexed or sliced from either the left (starting at 0) or the right (starting at -1).
- If you want the last code point of an arbitrary-length string, you can use [-1].
- The last three letters in a string can be "sliced off" using a negative index. e.g. 'beautiful'[:-3] == 'beauti'

## 4. Extract and transform a word

- Using [`str.split()`][str-split] returns a `list` of strings broken on white space.
- `lists` are sequences, and can be indexed.
- [`str.split()`][str-split] can be directly indexed: `'Exercism rocks!'.split()[0] == 'Exercism'`
- Be careful of punctuation! Periods can be removed via slice: `'dark.'[:-1] == 'dark'`
